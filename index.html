                Primary School, a boarding school at the Mathari Catholic Mission in Nyeri.  When she completed her studies
                there in 1956, she was rated first in her class, and was granted admission to the only Catholic high school
                for girls in Kenya, Loreto High School in Limuru.She received a scholarship to study at Mount St. Scholastica 
                College (now Benedictine College), in Atchison, Kansas, where she majored in biology, with minors in chemistry 
                and German. After receiving her Bachelor of Science degree in 1964, she studied at the University of 
                Pittsburgh for a master's degree in biology. Her graduate studies there were funded by the Africa-America Institute, 
                and during her time in Pittsburgh, she first experienced environmental restoration, when local environmentalists pushed
                to rid the city of air pollution. In January 1966, Maathai received her MSc in biological sciences, and was appointed to
                a position as research assistant to a professor of zoology at University College of Nairobi.</h4>
